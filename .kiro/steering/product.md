# Product Overview

AgentFlow is a production-grade Go framework for building LLM-powered AI agents with enterprise-level resilience and advanced capabilities.

## Core Value Proposition

- **Unified LLM Abstraction**: Single interface supporting multiple providers (OpenAI, Claude, Gemini)
- **Enterprise Resilience**: Built-in retry, idempotency, and circuit breaker patterns
- **Advanced Agent Capabilities**: Reflection, dynamic tool selection, multi-agent collaboration
- **Production Ready**: Comprehensive observability, cost tracking, and performance optimization

## Key Features

### Foundation (Stable)
- Multi-provider LLM support with unified interface
- Native tool calling with ReAct loop implementation
- Streaming responses (SSE)
- Context management with automatic compression
- Intelligent routing and load balancing

### 2025 Enhancements (New)
- **Reflection mechanism**: Self-evaluation and iterative improvement (+26% quality)
- **Dynamic tool selection**: Semantic matching with cost/latency optimization (-35% tokens)
- **Skills system**: Anthropic-standard dynamic skill loading
- **MCP integration**: Model Context Protocol for standardized tool integration
- **Enhanced memory**: 5-layer memory architecture (short/working/long/episodic/semantic)
- **Hierarchical agents**: Supervisor-Worker pattern for task decomposition
- **Multi-agent collaboration**: 5 collaboration patterns (debate/consensus/pipeline/broadcast/network)
- **Full observability**: Metrics, tracing, and evaluation system

## Target Use Cases

- Complex multi-step task processing
- Self-improving AI systems requiring quality feedback
- Multi-agent collaborative scenarios
- Long-term conversational systems with memory
